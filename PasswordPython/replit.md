# Overview

This is a password generator application built with Streamlit that creates secure, customizable passwords. The application allows users to specify password length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) to generate single or multiple passwords. It includes functionality to copy generated passwords to the clipboard for easy use.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web framework for rapid prototyping and deployment
- **UI Components**: Interactive widgets including sliders, checkboxes, and buttons for user input
- **Real-time Generation**: Immediate password generation based on user preferences without page refresh

## Core Logic
- **Password Generation**: Custom algorithm using Python's `random` module and `string` library
- **Character Set Building**: Dynamic character pool construction based on user selections
- **Multiple Password Support**: Batch generation capability for creating multiple passwords simultaneously

## User Interface Design
- **Input Controls**: 
  - Length slider for password customization
  - Boolean checkboxes for character type selection
  - Count selector for multiple password generation
- **Output Display**: Clear presentation of generated passwords with copy functionality
- **Validation**: Input validation to ensure at least one character type is selected

## Security Considerations
- **Randomization**: Uses Python's `random` module for pseudo-random character selection
- **Character Diversity**: Supports full range of character types including special symbols
- **No Storage**: Passwords are generated on-demand without persistent storage

# External Dependencies

## Core Libraries
- **streamlit**: Web application framework for creating the user interface
- **random**: Python standard library for random number generation
- **string**: Python standard library for character set definitions
- **pyperclip**: Third-party library for clipboard operations and copy functionality

## Deployment Requirements
- Python runtime environment
- Streamlit server for web hosting
- Browser compatibility for frontend rendering
